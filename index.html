                   Assam Engineering College is the first engineering institution of the North East India. With the advent of the IT boom, students started developing interests in the world of binary numbers and programming languages. As a push from this knack towards programming languages and softwares, the AEC Coding Club, was constituted in February 16'.<br>
                   Initially with only a few members, now it is one of the most thriving club in the college. It aims to ease out the fear for programming people develop and to build a sustainable peer-to-peer help group among the students as well as the alumnis.<br>
                   The club actively involves in conducting workshops on different programming languages like C, C++ and Python, and on latest on demand fields like web development, Android application development, Machine Learning, etc. Throughout the year, the club organises a few competitive events as well like CodeWar, which is the competitive programming competition of AEC Coding Club, held during Udbhavanam, the annual technical festival.
